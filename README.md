# Missing-Value-Treatment-simulation-in-Python

This time I would like to simulate missing value treatment of Greenhouse gas emissions, coal consumption and fossil fuel consumption. 

1. Extracting the data into panda data frames

2. See the values of each variables, as we can see that Greenhouse gas emissions only has 3 values compared to other variable's values.

3. Replace the missing values with mean

4. Now all variables have the same amount of values
